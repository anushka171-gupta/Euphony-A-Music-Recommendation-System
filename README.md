## Recommendation System
#### What recommendation technique was used in this project?
This project makes use of Content Based Filtering for suggesting the songs to the users based on the songs that are in their playlist or the search result. 
Content based filtering makes use of similarities in features of songs to suggest songs to the users. It has been implemented using K-means with cosine similarity. The dataset for the project was downloaded from kaggle.

#### Why was this technique used?
This algorithm was chosen as it does not require any data about the users which makes it easier to scale to a large number of users. The recommendations generated by content based filtering are tailored according to the user's interest. It avoids the "cold start" problem. Also it is generally easier to implement.
