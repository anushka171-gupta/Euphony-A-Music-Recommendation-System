## Introduction
Euphony is a website that offers thousands of songs to the users. From searching for a song to adding it to favourites list - Euphony allows a variety of features to help you find the music you are looking for. Get recommendations on the basis of your search result and your favourites list. Find similar artists to the ones you like.

## Setup
The first thing to do is to clone the repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/anushka171-gupta/Euphony-A-Music-Recommendation-System
$ cd Euphony-A-Music-Recommendation-System-master
```
Activate virtual environment:
```
$ env\Scripts\activate.bat
```
Installing requirements:
```
(env)$ cd Algorithm
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the application:
```
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```

## Recommendation System
#### What recommendation technique was used in this project?
This project makes use of Content Based Filtering for suggesting the songs to the users based on the songs that are in their playlist or the search result. 
Content based filtering makes use of similarities in features of songs to suggest songs to the users. It has been implemented using K-means with cosine similarity. The dataset for the project was downloaded from kaggle.

**K-Means Clustering**<br>
K-Means is an algorithm that tries to partition the dataset into K pre-defined distinct non-overlapping subgroups (clusters). Each data point belongs to only one group. It follows the approach of Expectation-Maximization. It works in the following way:
1. Specify number of clusters K.
2. Initialize centroids by first shuffling the dataset and then randomly selecting K data points for the centroids without replacement.
3. Keep iterating until there is no change to the centroids i.e. assignment of data points to clusters isn't changing.
4. Compute the sum of the squared distance between data points and all centroids.
5. Assign each data point to the closest cluster (centroid).
6. Compute the centroids for the clusters by taking the average of all the data points that belong to each cluster

**Cosine Similarity**<br>
Cosine Similarity is a measurement that quantifies the similarity between two or more vectors irrespective of their size. Mathematically, it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors projected in a multi-dimensional space.

#### Why was this technique used?
This algorithm was chosen as it does not require any data about the users which makes it easier to scale to a large number of users. The recommendations generated by content based filtering are tailored according to the user's interest. It avoids the "cold start" problem. Also it is generally easier to implement.
